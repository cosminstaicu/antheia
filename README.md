A live example of the interface can be checked at [antheia.voipit.ro](https://antheia.voipit.ro). There you can find the content of the `examples` folder.

Please check the [project wiki](https://github.com/cosminstaicu/antheia/wiki) for more details about the library.

The main project using this library is the Cloud PBX Service, called Accolades and provided by [VoIPIT Romania](https://www.voipit.ro).

## Installation

Use [composer](https://getcomposer.org) to install Antheia into your project:

```sh
composer require antheia/antheia
```

After the installation you need to set up a cache folder for the library. This folder must have a corresponding URL path and the library needs to have write permission on it. The folder can be set up, at runtime using the dedicated method: `Globals::setCache(string $url, string $path)`.

## Documentation

All code is documented using the PHPDoc standard, so fell free to use content assist, depending of your IDE (the library is written using [Eclipse PDT](https://www.eclipse.org/pdt/)). Also, the javascript files are documented using the JSDoc standard.

The examples (inside the example folder) are explained inside the [project wiki](https://github.com/cosminstaicu/antheia/wiki).

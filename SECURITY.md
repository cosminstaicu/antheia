# Security Policy

Thank you for making this library safer.

## Supported Versions

As there is only one main branch, security fixes are applied only to the latest released version. So, as long as you update the library to the latest version, everything should be ok.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x.x   | :x:|

Version 1.x.x has reached end of life (EOL) and is no longer supported.

Security vulnerabilities reported for 1.x.x will not be fixed.

Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest 2.x.x release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, **DO NOT OPEN A PUBLIC ISSUE** but send an email to cosminstaicu[@]gmail.com. I will acknowledge receipt of the report as soon as possible, typically within a few days.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help me better understand and resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

(the above list is a modified version from [GitHub platform samples security policy](https://github.com/github/platform-samples/security/policy))

Only vulnerabilities affecting supported versions (2.x.x) are eligible for security fixes. Issues reported for unsupported versions may be closed without action.

Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix has been released.

## Updates

Security issues are treated as a priority. Confirmed vulnerabilities affecting supported versions will be addressed as quickly as reasonably possible.

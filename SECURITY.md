# Security Policy

Thank you for making this library safer.

## Supported Versions

As there is only one main branch, every new release fixes any ongoing issues. So, as long as you update the library to the latest version, everything should be ok.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

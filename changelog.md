# Changelog

This file contains the main changes for the Antheia library.

The file format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This library uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - XXXX-XX-XX
 - breaks version 1.X.X (because of icon implementation and javascript class naming convention)
 - started a changelog file
 - this version breaks versions 1.X.X as icons are implemented in a different way
 - material icons are no longer used, as vector based icons (svg) are available inside the library
 - class naming convention changed — all classes now use the `Antheia` prefix and follow JavaScript class naming conventions (e.g., `ant_alert` becomes `AntheiaAlert`)
